This GitHub repository contains both the code (Jupyter Notebooks) and submissions (CSV Files) for the [Kaggle Plant Seedling Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification). 

## Methodologies

> Note: All notebooks were created on the Kaggle/Google Colab platforms where they fetch data from the Kaggle/Google Drive directories. It will not work by default on the Jupyter Notebook Platform.

### Approach 1: k-Means Clustering
> Navigate to `code/k-means-clustering.ipynb`

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook by clicking on the `+ New Notebook` button [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
2. Go to `File` --> `Open Notebook` and upload our  `.ipynb` file.
3. Add data by clicking on the `+ Add Data` button on the right pane, and search for `Plant Seedling Classification` under `Competiton Data`.
4. Run all cells. 

### Approach 2: kNN
> Navigate to `code/kNN.ipynb`

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook by clicking on the `+ New Notebook` button [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
2. Go to `File` --> `Open Notebook` and upload our  `.ipynb` file.
3. Add data by clicking on the `+ Add Data` button on the right pane, and search for `Plant Seedling Classification` under `Competiton Data`.
4. Run all cells. 

### Approach 3: Support Vector Machine
> Navigate to `code/support_vector_machine.ipynb`

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook by clicking on the `+ New Notebook` button [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
2. Go to `File` --> `Open Notebook` and upload our  `.ipynb` file.
3. Add data by clicking on the `+ Add Data` button on the right pane, and search for `Plant Seedling Classification` under `Competiton Data`.
4. Run all cells. 

### Approach 4: Convolutional Neural Network
> Navigate to `code/CNN.ipynb`

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook by clicking on the `+ New Notebook` button [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
2. Go to `File` --> `Open Notebook` and upload our  `.ipynb` file.
3. Add data by clicking on the `+ Add Data` button on the right pane, and search for `Plant Seedling Classification` under `Competiton Data`.
4. Run all cells. 

### Approach 5: Xception Net
> Navigate to `code/xception.ipynb`

1. Upload the notebook on the Google Colab platform by clicking on the `Upload` button [here](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Download the `Plant Seedling Classification` data through the Kaggle Competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification).
3. Unzip and upload the dataset into your root Google Drive Directory. 
5. Run all cells. 

Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions is a pre-trained model, created by FranÃ§ois Chollet, available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357). It is used as a transfer learning methodology via a Keras API documented [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/).

### Approach 6: Inception Resnet v2
> Navigate to `code/inception-resnet.ipynb`

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook by clicking on the `+ New Notebook` button [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
2. Go to `File` --> `Open Notebook` and upload our  `.ipynb` file.
3. Add data by clicking on the `+ Add Data` button on the right pane, and search for `Plant Seedling Classification` under `Competiton Data`.
4. Run all cells.  

Inception Resnet v2 was published in the paper 'Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning', by Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke, Alex Alemi, available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261). It is used as a transfer learning methodology via a Keras API documented [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/).
